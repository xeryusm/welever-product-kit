# Product Types Reference — Welever Product Kit Skills

Catalog of digital product types supported by the AI Digital Product Agent.
Each type includes its description, typical fixed structure, typical variables,
and an example product to illustrate the concept.

The key concept: every product has a **fixed structure** (elements that stay the same
on every page) and **variables** (elements that change from page to page). The AI agent
generates unique content for each page by combining the fixed structure with different
variable values.

## Identifying Fixed Structure vs. Variables

When working with a customer to define their product, use these questions:

### For Fixed Structure:
- "What elements appear on EVERY page of your product?"
- "What's the consistent format — does every entry have the same sections?"
- "What properties in the database stay the same across all entries?"

### For Variables:
- "What changes from one page/entry to the next?"
- "What makes each entry unique?"
- "What data does the AI need to generate different content for each page?"

### The Smoothie Library Example (from the training):
- **Fixed structure:** Recipe name field, calorie table, carbs field, description field, dietary tag
- **Variables:** The actual recipe name, specific calorie count, specific ingredients, specific instructions

The AI prompt uses the fixed structure as the template and plugs in variable values
for each database entry. This is what allows one prompt to generate hundreds of
unique pages.
