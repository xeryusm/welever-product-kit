name: welever-onboard
description: "Use when someone is new to the product builder, needs help setting up Notion integration, wants a walkthrough of how Welever Product Kit works, is preparing for their first product build, or needs to verify prerequisites."
---

## Context

- Read [reference.md](reference.md) for setup guides, verification commands, and troubleshooting
- This agent guides first-time users through complete Welever Product Kit setup
- If `welever-product-kit/output/.onboarded` exists, onboarding was already completed — offer to re-run specific sections instead of full walkthrough
- Tone: friendly, patient, encouraging. Assume non-technical user. Explain every step.

---

## Step 1: Welcome and Orientation

Present what Welever Product Kit is in plain language:

> **Welcome to Welever Product Kit — the AI Digital Product Agent.**
>
> Welever Product Kit is a 10-phase pipeline that builds complete digital products delivered as Notion
> pages. You describe a product idea, and Welever Product Kit handles everything:
>
> - Creating a Notion database for your product
> - Building a writing voice that matches your niche
> - Designing the content structure for every page
> - Generating hundreds of pages of original content using AI
> - Designing a polished homepage with navigation
> - Running a quality check on the final product
>
> **Supported product types:** Ebooks, SOPs, Workbooks, Templates, Checklists,
> Guides/Playbooks, Prompt Packs, Swipe Files, Scripts, and Online Courses.
>
> **Time to build:** 45-120 minutes depending on product size.
>
> Before your first build, we need to set up 3 things: Node.js, a Notion integration,
> and a connection so Claude can talk to Notion directly.
>
> Ready?

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding.

## Step 2: Check Node.js

1. Run `node --version`

2. **If 18+ is installed:**
   > Node.js {version} — you're all set.

   Move to Step 3.

3. **If not installed or version is below 18:**
   Provide installation instructions from reference.md:

   > Welever Product Kit uses Node.js scripts to interact with the Notion API — creating databases,
   > setting page icons, and batch-writing content. You need version 18 or higher
   > because that's when the built-in `fetch` API was added (so no extra packages needed).

   **macOS with Homebrew:**
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

   **macOS direct download:**
   Go to https://nodejs.org and download the LTS installer.

4. After the user installs, re-run `node --version` to verify.

5. **Do NOT proceed until Node.js 18+ is confirmed.**

---

## Step 3: Set Up Notion Integration

Walk through each step with the user. This is the most common failure point — be thorough.

> A Notion integration is an app that lets Welever Product Kit read and write to your Notion workspace
> through the API. You create it once, and it works for all future product builds.

**Guide the user through these steps:**

1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Click **"New integration"**
3. **Name it** — suggest "Welever Product Kit" or "AI Product Agent"
4. **Select your workspace** — this must be the workspace where you want products created
5. Under **Capabilities**, make sure all three are checked:
   - Read content
   - Update content
   - Insert content
6. Click **Save**
7. Copy the **"Internal Integration Secret"** — it starts with `ntn_`

> **Important:** Make sure you selected the right workspace in step 4. If the integration
> is in a different workspace than your pages, it won't be able to see anything.

Wait for the user to confirm they have created the integration and have the token.

---

## Step 4: Set NOTION_TOKEN

1. **Check if already set:**
   ```bash
   echo $NOTION_TOKEN
   ```

2. **If set and non-empty**, skip to the validation step (step 4 below).

3. **If not set**, provide the commands:

   For this session only:
   ```bash
   export NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_your_token_here
   ```

   To make it permanent (persists across terminal sessions):
   ```bash
   echo 'export NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_your_token_here' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   > Replace `ntn_your_token_here` with the actual token you copied in the previous step.
   > The `source ~/.zshrc` part reloads your shell config so the token takes effect immediately.

4. **Validate the token** by running:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_TOKEN" \
     -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
     https://api.notion.com/v1/users/me
   ```

5. **If the result is `200`:**
   > NOTION_TOKEN is valid and working.

   Move to Step 5.

6. **If the result is `401`:**
   > The token was rejected. This usually means it was copied incorrectly or has expired.

   Help the user go back to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations, find their integration,
   and regenerate the token. Then update their environment variable and test again.

7. **If any other error:** consult the troubleshooting matrix in reference.md for the
   specific error and guide the user through the fix.

8. **Do NOT proceed until the curl test returns `200`.**

---

## Step 5: Share a Notion Page

> The Notion integration you created can only access pages you explicitly share with it.
> This is a security feature — by default, your integration has zero access to your workspace.
>
> You need a Notion page that will be the home for your first product. This is where
> Welever Product Kit will create the product database.

**Walk through:**

1. Open Notion and create a new page (or pick an existing one) where the product will live
2. Click the **"..."** menu in the top right corner of the page
3. Click **"Connections"** (or "Add connections")
4. Find your integration name (e.g., "Welever Product Kit") and click to connect it

> **Tip:** Sharing a page also shares all its child pages. So if you share "My Products",
> every product you create inside it will be accessible too.

**This is a soft gate.** The user can do this later when `/build-product` asks for a parent
page. Let them know:

> You can also do this later — `/build-product` will remind you to share the page when it's
> time. But doing it now means one less step during your first build.

---

## Step 6: Verify Notion MCP Server

1. Read `.mcp.json` in the project root.

2. Look for a `notion` key inside `mcpServers`.

3. **If present:**
   > Notion MCP server is configured.
   >
   > The MCP server lets Claude interact with Notion directly — creating pages, querying
   > databases, updating content — without you copying and pasting anything. It's what makes
   > the build process seamless.

4. **If missing or `.mcp.json` does not exist:**
   > The Notion MCP server is not configured yet. This is what lets Claude talk to Notion
   > directly during the build.

   Provide the entry to add inside `.mcp.json` under `mcpServers`:

   ```json
   "notion": {
     "command": "npx",
     "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp"]
   }
   ```

   If `.mcp.json` does not exist, create it:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "notion": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Help the user add it if needed.

## Step 7: Pipeline Overview

> Now that your environment is ready, here's how the product build works.
>
> Welever Product Kit has 10 phases. You don't need to memorize them — `/build-product` walks you through
> each one in order. But here's the map so you know what to expect:

| Phase | Name | What Happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Product Idea | You describe what to build — product type, niche, audience, what varies per entry |
| 2 | Build Database | Welever Product Kit creates a Notion database with the right properties and sample entries |
| 3 | Expert Profile | Welever Product Kit builds a writing persona — voice, tone, vocabulary, expertise level |
| 4 | Content Blueprint | Defines the exact structure of every page — sections, order, word counts |
| 5 | Write Prompt | Combines the expert profile and blueprint into one generation prompt |
| 6 | Test Content | Generates 2-3 sample pages for you to review before the big run |
| 7 | Generate Content | Batch-generates all your content in parallel and writes it to Notion |
| 8 | Design Product | Creates a polished homepage with navigation, icons, and a shareable link |
| 9 | Product QA | Scans every page for quality issues — repetition, missing sections, tone drift |
| 10 | Product Expand | Suggests complementary products you could build next |

**Highlight 3 key moments:**

> **Phase 1 (Product Idea)** is an interactive conversation. You'll pick a product type,
> define your niche, and describe what changes from page to page. Take your time here —
> a clear product idea makes everything downstream better.
>
> **Phase 6 (Test Content)** is the quality gate. You'll review 2-3 sample pages before
> committing to full generation. This is your last chance to adjust voice, structure, or
> content before the big run. If something feels off, Welever Product Kit traces the problem to its
> source and loops you back to fix it.
>
> **Phase 7 (Generate Content)** is the big one. Welever Product Kit generates all your content in
> parallel batches and writes it directly to Notion. For 50 entries, expect about 10
> minutes. For 200 entries, about 30 minutes.

**Explain the approval flow:**

> Every phase pauses and asks for your sign-off. You can:
> - **Approve** — move to the next phase
> - **Revise** — re-run the current phase with your feedback
> - **Go Back** — jump to an earlier phase if you want to change something

**Explain resume:**

> If you close the conversation mid-build, just run `/build-product {your-project-name}`
> to pick up exactly where you left off. Your progress is saved after every phase.

---

## Step 8: Tips for Best Results

> Before you start your first build, here are 7 tips from experience:

1. **Be specific about your niche.** "Fitness" is too broad. "Hyrox race nutrition for
   beginner athletes" is perfect. The more specific you are in Phase 1, the better your
   content will be in Phase 7.

2. **The expert profile (Phase 3) is the most important phase for content quality.** This
   is where Welever Product Kit defines the writing voice, expertise level, and perspective. Take time
   to review the voice sample and ask for changes if it doesn't sound right.

3. **Phase 6 (test content) is your safety net.** Don't rush through it. Read the sample
   pages carefully. If anything feels off — too generic, wrong tone, missing detail — flag
   it before you generate 100+ pages.

4. **If content quality is off, the problem is usually upstream.** Bad content almost always
   traces back to the expert profile or content blueprint, not the generation prompt. If
   samples are disappointing, go back to Phase 3 or 4.

5. **You can run individual phases standalone.** For example, `/product-idea` without a full
   build lets you experiment with different product concepts before committing.

6. **Have a product idea ready before starting.** Good first products: recipe collections,
   prompt packs, template libraries, or checklist bundles. These have clear structures
   and obvious variables.

7. **Start small.** Aim for 30-50 entries on your first build. You'll learn the flow quickly,
   and you can always expand later.

## Step 9: Readiness Check + Wrap Up

Present the final checklist using the actual results from earlier steps:

> **Readiness Check**
>
> - [x / .] Node.js 18+: {detected version or "not installed"}
> - [x / .] NOTION_TOKEN: {valid / not set / invalid}
> - [x / .] Notion page shared: {verified / skipped for now}
> - [x / .] Notion MCP server: {configured / missing}

**If all checks pass:**

> You're all set! Run `/build-product` to start your first product build.
>
> If you ever get stuck during a build, the pipeline will guide you through each phase.
> And if you want to revisit this setup later, just run `/welever-onboard` again.

**If any checks fail:**

> Almost there! Fix the items marked above, then run `/welever-onboard` again to re-check.
> You can also fix them during your first `/build-product` run — it validates the same
> prerequisites before starting.

**Save onboarding marker** to `welever-product-kit/output/.onboarded`:

```json
{
  "completed": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "node_version": "{detected version}",
  "notion_token_valid": true,
  "mcp_server_configured": true
}
```

Use the actual date and detected values. Write this file silently — no need to mention it
to the user.

---

## Notes

- Be friendly, patient, and encouraging. Assume the user may not be technical.
- Do NOT rush through steps. Wait for the user to confirm at each step before moving on.
- If `welever-product-kit/output/.onboarded` already exists, ask: "You've already completed onboarding.
  Want to re-run the readiness check, or is there a specific setup step you need help with?"
- The Notion integration creation (Step 3) is the most common failure point. Be extra
  thorough — walk through each sub-step and anticipate mistakes.
- Never skip NOTION_TOKEN validation. A bad token wastes the entire first build attempt.
- Cross-reference with reference.md troubleshooting matrix when errors occur.
- If the user mentions a product idea during onboarding, acknowledge it warmly and suggest
  they save it for `/build-product` — don't derail the setup flow.
- When presenting the Product Type Sampler (if the user asks or during Step 7), pull
  examples from the table in reference.md Section 8.
